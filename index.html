		  <h1>Isn't it awesome being special?</h1>
<h2>With great power there must also come ... great responsibility!</h2>
<p>As a professional Mainframe Systems Programmer one needs extreme authorizations on the system from time to time.
Sometimes it's to be able to restore data you are not authorized for by default, sometimes it's so you can add some security settings.
At other times it's just to perform some rudimentary <i>display commands</i> or install or configure some product.</p>
<p>At most shops security on The Mainframe is <i>very tight</i>. At some sites Systems Programmers are not allowed to be "SPECIAL" or "OPERATIONS".
This mostly means only the security guys are authorized to change security settings, resulting in tedious and longer turn-around times for projects than need be.
(Depending on the competence level of your security guys your milage may vary). On the other hand, if your shop has a setup where *you* the Systems Programmer is
entitled to be "SPECIAL" this means you *always* have FULL AUTHORITY on the system, making you have to think twice before doing anything, because you're hardly ever 
blocked by security settings. This may result in unwanted (and mostly unplanned) results.<p>
<h2>A committee is a group that keeps minutes and loses hours</h2>
<p>Why not have both? We at zdevops firmly believe a Systems Programmer needs to be "SPECIAL" or "OPERATIONS" from time to time.
We also believe it's extremely dangerous to always have FULL AUTHORITY on the system. But we also think procedures and
corporate cumberness should not have a negative impact on a Systems Programmer's effectiveness.</p>
<h3>I've got sudo on my machine....</h3>
<p>On the <i>newer</i> *nix platforms it's a common thing to "su" before altering 'critical' settings.
The module presented in <a href="http://link.to/zdosu">this repository</a> does somewhat of the same thing. It provides a mechanism to
<strong>temporarily</strong> gain "SPECIAL" or "OPERATIONS" attributes.</p>
<h3>...this stuff is ancient</h3>
<p>This functionality has been about since
the start of time (epoch-wise at least I'd say) and we at zdevops.com are by no means trying to claim credit for it.
We're merely expanding and sharing things thought of by others because, quite frankly, we don't want to see this
information lost. And judging by the ever increasing average age of the Mainframe Systems Programmers chances are this knowledge
might get lost in time forever.</p>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
Basically this module will add or remove "SPECIAL" or "OPERATIONS" attributes from your 'current session'.
Because of the extreme consequences this might have RACF is used to permit 
usage of this module. Without the proper PERMIT this program does hardly anything more than 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEFBR14" target="_blank">IEFBR14</a>.
With the proper authorization however, this module will grant the caller with the powers of 
"SPECIAL" and/or "OPERATIONS". And we all know the famous Stan Lee quote when it comes to
"great powers".
</p>

<h2>How do I get this running?</h2>
Hold your horses there. Before you can even start 'installing' and using this module
there are a couple of requirements that need to be fullfilled before you can start:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Are you sure you want to implement this?</strong><br />
	You might want to talk about this with your manager, your CEO/CFO/CTO or even your security guys.
	This 'tool' potentially creates an enourmous back-door into your sites security mechanisms. 
	We know it's only with good intent, but it will never harm to have some 'managerial backing' on this.</li>
	<li><strong>Access to SPECIAL</strong></br />
	Due to the nature of this module (it does alter storage in KEY ZERO) it
	needs to run in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Call_instruction" target="_blank">Supervisor State</a>, hence it
	needs to be compiled with AC(1) requiring you to be "SPECIAL" in order to do so.
	Furthermore, the module needs to reside in an "APF Authorized library" (you can google that one yourself). These libraries are
	mostly well guarded by various security settings.</li> 
	<li><strong>RACF</strong><br />
	This module has been coded with RACF in mind. If you shop uses "TopSecret" or "ACF2" it will not run.
	The good thing about open-sourcing this module is, there might be someone out there running ACF2 and
	altering the source so it will work with ACF2 too :)</li>
	<li><strong>SMP/e</strong><br />
	In order to 'install' this feature you need to have some basic SMP/e knwoledge as this module is
	provided as 'USERMOD'. We do also provide you with the source (scroll down) so you can build it
	yourself, outside of SMP/e. (example JCL is provided).</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<h2>Installing via SMP/e</h2>
<p>Head on over to our repository on github and download ZDO45000 from the SMPE directory.
From there on you should upload this to your Mainframe and perform a regular APPLY.</p>

<h2>Installing via JCL</h2>
<p>Again, head on over to our repository on GitHub and this time download INSTALL from the JCL directory.
Change the JOBCARD and submit the job. It's #EPLS</p>

<h2>Allowing users or groups to execute the module</h2>
<p>As stated, this module requires RACF authorization to perform it's magic.
This 'functionality' is there for a reason. Without it any user(!!) could
upgrade himself to become "SPECIAL". Because this just give us shivers down 
our spine, we require user to have read to 'ZDEVOPS.AUTH.*' in the FACILITY class.
In order to grant a user (or group) access to the module you need to PERMIT them to
the resource. An example is shown below:
<pre><code>/* Define the profile */
RDEFINE FACILITY ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* UACC(NONE) 
SETROPTS RACLIST(FACILITY) REFRESH 

/* Permit a user/group and refresh */
PERMIT ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* CLASS(FACILITY) ID(xxxx) ACC(READ) 
SETROPTS RACLIST(FACILITY) REFRESH</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
ZDOSU can be used from within a batch job (JCL) and in TSO.

<pre><code>//MYJOB       JOB,'Example job'
//*           RUN A JOB WITH SPECIAL (SO WE CAN DO RACF AND THINGS)
//STEP01 EXEC PGM=ZDOSU,PARM='SPECIAL'
//*           THIS WILL SET SPECIAL BIT IN ACEE
//STEP02 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD *
  ..
  .. add your RACF COMMANDS
  ..
</code></pre>

If you want to be able to call this module from within TSO make sure to 
add the program to the authorized programs in your IKJTSOxx member.

<pre><code>...
AUTHPGM NAMES(            /* AUTHORIZED PROGRAMS */ +
   ..                  +
   IRRUT100            +
   IRRUT200            +
   ZDOSU)                 /* ADD THIS LINE */
</code></pre>

<h2>Messages and Logging</h2>
Due to the potential dangerous effect as a result of using this module every invocation of the program will be logged in SYSLOG.

This is message <strong>ZDOSU0000I : EXECUTION STARTED</strong>.<br />
From SYSLOG one can determine the originating TSO address space, providing you with an audit trail to the executing user.</p>
<p>There are however a couple more messages this module can generate. For completeness sake all of them are provided below.
<pre><code><strong>ZDOSU0000I : EXECUTION STARTED</strong>
This message is written to SYSLOG only and indicates usage of the module.
This happens regardless of success or failure. Provides basic audit trail.

<strong>ZDOSU1000E : PARAMETER ERROR</strong>
ZDOSU needs to be called with a parameter. This parameter can be one of:
- SPECIAL (set SPECIAL)
- OPERATIONS (set OPERATIONS)
- NOSPECIAL (remove SPECIAL)
- NOOPERATIONS (remoce OPERATIONS)
Failure to provide this parameter results in this message.

<strong>ZDOSU2000E : ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* NOT DEFINED</strong>
Because of the nasty nature of this module we are performing a RACROUTE
to the profile 'ZDEVOPS.AUTH.*' in the FACILITY-class. If this profile
has not been defined the module terminates with this message.

<strong>ZDOSU3000E : USAGE NOT PERMITTED</strong>
User has no access to ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* in FACILITY-class. Module terminates.
</code></pre>
<p>These are all the messages ZDOSU can potentially generate. It should serve as a 
guide to using the module</p>

<h3>Inside scoop</h3>
So how is it done? ZDOSU is written in ASSEMBLY and therefor extremely awesome and efficient.
You can easily head on over to the repository at GitHub and awe at the code there.
Below you will find some snippets from the source. This will most likely be parsed succesfully by ASMA90, however it is not the not full version. We
urge you always download sources from the GitHub repository.</p>

<p>That being said, here's the code :<br />
<pre><code>ZDOSU    CSECT
         BAKR  14,0                    PUSH REGISTERS
         LR    12,15                   LOAD ENTRY ADDRESS INTO R12
         USING ZDOSU,12                ESTABLISH ADDRESSABILITY
         L     2,0(1)                  LOAD PARM POINTER
         LH    3,0(2)                  R3:=PARM LENGTH
         CH    3,=H'6'                 LESS THAN 6 ?
         BL    ZDOSUE1                 BRANCH TO ERROR :)
         LA    3,2(2)                  LOAD PARM DATA ADDRESS
ZDOSULG  WTO   'ZD0000I : EXECUTION STARTED!',ROUTCDE=(9)

               ATTR=READ,CLASS='FACILITY',MSGSUPP=NO
RETURN   PR                            POP REGISTERS AND RETURN
ZDOSUE1  WTO   'ZDO1000E : PARAMETER ERROR',ROUTCDE=(11)
         LA    15,4
         B     RETURN

ZDOSUE2  WTO   'ZDO2000E : ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* NOT DEFINED',ROUTCDE=(11)

         LTORG
ZDOSUE3  WTO   'ZDO3000E : USAGE NOT PERMITTED',ROUTCDE=(11)

ENTITYX  DC    H'0',H'14',C'ZDEVOPS.'
RESSUF   DC    CL5'AUTH.*'
         END   ZDOSU
</code></pre>
<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>
<p>Seeing as you've read all the way past the source-code we will get a bit more nerdy on the whole z/OS thing. Every address space succesfully executing ZDOSU (with PARM='SPECIAL') will have it's "SPECIAL" flag waving in the wind. There's virtually nothing this address space cannot do......</p>
<p>By walking down the ASXB tree we can end up at the ACEE and flip some bits in that area.</p>
<img src="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/zos/v1r11/topic/com.ibm.zos.r11.ichb200/ichb2g23.gif" width=500 /> 
<p>Before the program decides to flip some bits, it first issues a RACROUTE to test if the current user has READ on ZDEVOPS.AUTH.* in the facility class. It also checks if there's an argument of at least 6 bytes (SPECIA,OPERAT,NOSPEC,NOOPER). And even before all this has happend a message was written to SYSLOG (route code 9) providing information for an audit trail regarding incivations of the progam. After that, it's a piece of pie.</p>
